git add: 

The git add command is used to stage changes and prepare them for a commit. You can specify individual files or directories to stage or use git add . to stage all modified files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

Example:

bash
Copy code
git add file1.txt          # Stage a specific file
git add directory/         # Stage all changes in a directory
git add .                  # Stage all changes in the current directory and subdirectories


git commit: 

The git commit command creates a new commit with the staged changes. It requires a commit message that describes the changes you are committing. The commit message should be meaningful and concise.

Example:

sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Add new feature"      # Commit with a commit message
git push: The git push command is used to push your local commits to the remote repository. It updates the branch on the remote repository with your local changes. You need to specify the remote repository and branch you want to push to, such as origin master.

Example:

perl
Copy code
git push origin master               # Push local commits to the remote 'master' branch
Here's the overall sequence of commands:

sql
Copy code
# Stage changes
git add <file1> <file2> ...
or
git add .

# Create a commit
git commit -m "Commit message"

# Push the commit to the remote repository
git push <remote> <branch>
Remember to replace <file1>, <file2>, <remote>, and <branch> with the appropriate values for your project.

By following these steps, you can effectively stage your changes, create a commit with a descriptive message, and push your commits to the remote repository on GitHub (or any other Git hosting service).
